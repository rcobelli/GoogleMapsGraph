## How it works
Simply tell it where you are starting from and where you are going. You can also select the algorithm that Google will use to check your estimated travel time. Hit submit and you'll receive a graph of how long the trip will take depending on when you leave.

## Installation
1. Get a Google Maps API key from [https://console.developers.google.com](https://console.developers.google.com)
2. Update the credentials in `config example.ini`
3. Rename `config example.ini` to `config.ini`
4. Place the code on a server capable of running PHP
